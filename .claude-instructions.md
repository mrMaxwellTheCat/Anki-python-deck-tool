## Claude-Specific Notes

When working with this project:

1. **Always check** `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for the latest guidelines
2. **File Organization**: Create documentation files in `docs/`, not root directory
3. **Testing**: Maintain 80%+ coverage (currently 96.77%)
4. **VSCode Tasks**: Use tasks to run CI locally before pushing
5. **Python Version**: 3.10+ required (use modern type hints)

## Most Important Rules

- ✅ Save summaries/guides in `docs/` directory
- ✅ Use absolute imports (`from anki_tool.core import...`)
- ✅ Use Python 3.10+ type hints (`list[str]`, not `List[str]`)
- ✅ Test everything (pytest with >80% coverage)
- ❌ Don't modify `stable_id()` function
- ❌ Don't create `*_SUMMARY.md` files in root
- ❌ Don't use `print()` - use `click.echo()`
