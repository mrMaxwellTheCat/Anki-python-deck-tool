- concept: "List Comprehension"
  language: "python"
  code: |
    numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    squares = [x**2 for x in numbers]
    # Result: [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]
  explanation: "List comprehensions provide a concise way to create lists based on existing lists. More readable and often faster than using loops."

- concept: "Dictionary Comprehension"
  language: "python"
  code: |
    words = ['hello', 'world']
    lengths = {word: len(word) for word in words}
    # Result: {'hello': 5, 'world': 5}
  explanation: "Similar to list comprehensions but creates dictionaries. Useful for transforming data structures."

- concept: "Lambda Function"
  language: "python"
  code: |
    square = lambda x: x**2
    result = square(5)  # Returns 25
    
    # Common with map/filter
    numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]
    doubled = list(map(lambda x: x*2, numbers))
  explanation: "Anonymous functions defined with lambda. Useful for simple operations, especially with map(), filter(), and sorted()."

- concept: "Context Manager (with statement)"
  language: "python"
  code: |
    with open('file.txt', 'r') as f:
        content = f.read()
    # File automatically closed
  explanation: "Context managers ensure resources are properly managed. The file is automatically closed even if an exception occurs."

- concept: "Destructuring Assignment"
  language: "javascript"
  code: |
    const person = { name: 'John', age: 30 };
    const { name, age } = person;
    
    const colors = ['red', 'green', 'blue'];
    const [first, second] = colors;
  explanation: "Destructuring allows unpacking values from arrays or properties from objects into distinct variables."

- concept: "Arrow Functions"
  language: "javascript"
  code: |
    // Traditional function
    function add(a, b) { return a + b; }
    
    // Arrow function
    const add = (a, b) => a + b;
    
    // With block body
    const multiply = (a, b) => {
      return a * b;
    };
  explanation: "Arrow functions provide a shorter syntax and lexically bind 'this'. Ideal for callbacks and functional programming."

- concept: "Slice Operation"
  language: "go"
  code: |
    // Create a slice
    nums := []int{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
    
    // Slice operations
    subset := nums[1:4]  // [2, 3, 4]
    first3 := nums[:3]   // [1, 2, 3]
    last2 := nums[3:]    // [4, 5]
  explanation: "Slices are dynamic arrays in Go. The syntax [low:high] creates a slice including low but excluding high."

- concept: "SQL JOIN"
  language: "sql"
  code: |
    SELECT users.name, orders.total
    FROM users
    INNER JOIN orders ON users.id = orders.user_id
    WHERE orders.total > 100;
  explanation: "INNER JOIN returns records that have matching values in both tables. Essential for relational database queries."
